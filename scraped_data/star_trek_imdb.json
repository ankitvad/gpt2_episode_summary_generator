All major Enterprise officers take starship commands, including Data, who had to ask for this first and immediately faces a transfer request from his first officer, Lt. Commander Christopher Hobson, who has a prejudice against androids, yet Data keeps him on. Picard is startled to hear that the Romulan commander Sela claims to be Tasha's daughter, first thinks it's a lie, then hears Guinan's theory confirmed, which would mean the previous Enterprise is indirectly responsible for the present conflict. Now the civil war is going badly, Worf's loyalty to Gowron and his family leadership are challenged at his own side, he falls in the hands of the Duras sisters, Lursa and B'Etor. Picard coordinates his fleet with Gowron's forces, facing Romulan forces outside Federation space, but Sela decides on an unforeseen strategy, which makes Data's ship's position crucial...",

As Picard resists physical pain, psychological torture by lies is used, but he also finds a way to retort there.",

While Picard disapproves of genetic 'predisposition' on principle, Troi becomes a platonic intimate with Conor, who would be prepared to accept her even as a genetically inferior mate. The deflection works at the last second before energy would have been fatally over-expended: the colony is safe from impact, but Hannah reports fatal tectonic damage, which Geordi soon finds to be faked in order to get out of her controlled life.

A visit from Picard makes them realize the key must be Romulan senator Pardek, with whom Spock maintains years-long personal contacts, against Sarek's will. Meanwhile Klingon leader Gowron is writing the Federation's help in the civil war out of official history, so Picard resorts to suggestions to get him to provide a cloaked ship, reluctantly piloted by Captain K'Vada, for this mission, with Data, both prepared to impersonate Romulans on Romulus. Meanwhile Commander William T. Riker and Troi find examining the disappearance of a Federation ship to and from the Ferengi most dangerous.",

When Sisko gets to talk with Kai Opaka, the Bajoran religious leader, she tells him he is the long awaited emissary of the Bajorans.

Soon, the Federation's science officer, Jadzia Dax, a Trill: medical officer Dr. Julian Bashir, and Chief of Operations, Miles O'Brien arrive, and before there's even a chance to settle down and begin clean-up operations, a mysterious wormhole appears, exhibiting the unusual ability of having stability - which no other work hole had ever demonstrated. Very quickly, what was initially thought to be an outpost at the very furthest reaches of the Federation - and, the Alpha Quadrant - turns out to be a crossroads; for some, familiar races and dangers; to others, never encountered before.",

Then a major Duras fleet appears and Picard refuses the military help requested by Gowron and Worf, who then declines to resume his post when leaves are canceled, so he honorably resigns to keep fighting at Gowron's side...",

The ship is also being probed by an outside force that seems to have a complaint against Q, who now expects his fellow humans to protect him. In the end, Q realizes there is only one solution for him.",

Kurn had specifically requested assignment to the Enterprise and with good reason: he is actually Worf's younger brother who, unknown to Worf himself, survived the attack that killed their parents. He's come to Worf with news that their father has been declared a traitor and that as the older brother, he wants Worf to lead the challenge.

He is received with full presidential honors and Kirk and Spock agree to beam down with him, but as they do, phasers and tricorders fail to dematerialize with them, and communicators won't work.

Kirk appoints Spock as liaison for the group during their stay on the Enterprise. Dr. Sevrin demands to be taken to Eden, but Kirk refuses on the grounds that his orders from Starfleet dictate that the group be taken to the nearest star base.

His desire to abandon technology and join the \"primitive\" inhabitants of planet Eden could well result in their destruction. As a precaution, Dr. Sevrin is quarantined, but Spock agrees to plot a course to the mythical planet of Eden in exchange for his cooperation. Meanwhile, Chekov inadvertently gives away some vital information about auxiliary control to his former classmate, Irina, and she and the rest of the followers soon free Sevrin and hijack the Enterprise.

Lokai is a fugitive belonging to a slave race in rebellion and is therefore relentlessly chased throughout the galaxy by commissioner Bele of the arrogant master race. Even on board, their obsessional fight resumes, with Lokai haranguing for support while Bele abuses his extraordinary mental power to bend the ship to his will and deliver Lokai to their home planet. This behavior delays the ship's crucial mission far too long, leaving Kirk no other choice than to bluff by starting the ship's self-destruct sequence.",

Kirk has a hard job ahead: Elaan starts by refusing and insulting the royal wedding gifts before stabbing the ambassador, which forces Kirk to step in as a Petruchio to her shrewish Kate. As if this isn't bad enough, a Klingon warship is found, distantly dogging the Enterprise. As one of the Elasian bodyguards conducts sabotage, Elaan resorts to the ultimate, biochemical weapon of fiendish Elasian females: a supreme love potion contained in their tears that enslaves any man for life who touches them.

Suddenly, one of the away team seems to disappear from Dr. McCoy's sight. After the away team beams back up, a series of strange things begin to occur. One such thing is the appearance of an alien device installed to the life support machinery, which can't be removed because it's protected by a powerful force field. Going back up to the bridge, Capt. Kirk notices everyone on the bridge is slowing down to a near-stop. He's been hyper-accelerated in time so that he moves at super-speed compared to the crew. He then meets the aliens they beamed down to help: the Scalosians. They've been stuck in hyper-acceleration since radiation poisoned their planet's water supply. Their men are also sterile, so they must lure space vessels to recruit males for reproductive purposes. Kirk finds his missing crewman, who seems to relish his new life and has helped the Scalosians install their device to the life support, which will freeze the crew so that there will be a fresh supply of fertile males for generations. But a simple injury inflicted by a Scalosian man causes the crewman's body to age to death in mere minutes. Kirk rebels, but then pretends to accede to the Scalosians' plan. Meanwhile, the bridge crew saw Kirk vanish. Spock investigates and figures out that they have hyper-accelerated invaders. He and McCoy isolate the acceleration factor and its cure. Spock accelerates himself and finds Kirk. Together, they defeat the aliens and banish them back to their planet. Kirk then takes the cure, while Spock remains hyper-accelerated until he undoes all the modifications the Scalosians had made to the Enterprise.",

    "episode_summary": "Kirk, McCoy, and Lieutenants Chekov and Johnson beam down to a planet where 100 human colonists are reportedly attacked, but sensor readings bear no evidence of this. A Klingon ship approaches, which is suddenly disabled, drifting. Captain Kang of the Klingons, who also received a distress call, beams down and captures Kirk's party, holding them responsible for his 400 dead crewmen and claiming the Enterprise. As each captain heatedly accuses the other of breaking the three-year Klingon-Federation truce, a shimmering, formless alien watches unnoticed, causing Chekov to lunge at Kang for the murder of his brother. Chekov is tortured, and Kirk, to stop it, agrees to beam them all aboard. The alien follows unseen, traps most crewmen, takes over the ship, and bumps it up to warp nine. When Kirk confronts Kang about it, equipment turns to swords, and the two factions start hacking away at each other. Several men, even McCoy, get murderous delusions. Spock's sensor readings show both sides have 38 armed men, but there is more life force registered aboard than can be accounted for by humans and Klingons, an entity that proves intelligent, able to alter both matter and minds, and bent of keeping warring factions evenly matched. While Kang takes over engineering and cuts life support for all human-held sections, the alien keeps causing surprises without letting anyone die, but why? Kirk tries to convince the Klingons there's a worse enemy aboard that's toying with both races.",

When a Vulcan mind probe to attempt escape fails, as punishment two crewmen are instantly reduced to solid organic matter, one crushed irrevocably but the other restored as a demonstration. Spock deduces such is the Kelvans' normal state. Kirk tells him to fake sickness and modify diagnostic equipment to attempt reversing the Kelvan nervous control field; McCoy is allowed to bring him aboard the Enterprise. Spock finds the engine modification is cased in an impenetrable material and proposes a sabotage which will make the ship explode while it passes a natural energy barrier but Kirk fails to order the explosion; the Kelvans were aware of the plan and 'neutralize' all non-essential human crew as revivable matter. Spock observes the Kelvans have sacrificed all non-intellectual mind functions, and are thus vulnerable in their present human form to sense-stimulation, so the remaining crew bombards them with sensuality, which indeed throws them off balance, even striving amongst each-other. When they realize being weakened, Kirk makes them an an offer...",

At first, the Enterprise under M-5's control easily defeats two other starships, but, quickly begins to act independently of its human masters, Daystrom has little interest in disconnecting the M-5 and treats it more like an errant child than a machine.

There mission is to find out what happened to a small maquis ship on which captain Janeway's chief of security, Lieutenant Tuvok, has infiltrated. The crew begins tracking the ship by starting at their last known location and tracking their engine emissions. This leads them into a very turbulent and unpredictable area of space known as the Bad Lands. Whilst still tracking the missing maquis ship, Voyager is pulled in to an unknown anomaly which transports them to the Delta Quadrant, 75,000 light years from home on the other side of the galaxy. As if thay weren't bad enough, many crew members are seriously injured or killed during the trip including Voyager's first officer, doctor, Nurse and Chief Engineer. After stopping a potential breach of the warp core, the entire crew of the USS Voyager is transported to a large array-like device. On board, a suitable environment is created for them to wait, however being typical Starfleet officer, Captain Janeway is unable to just sit and wait. She wants to know what exactly is going on and who has brought her and her crew to the other side of the galaxy. While poking around, Lieutenant Paris and Ensign Kim discover a strange energy signature in a barn. When the rest of the crew arrive, all pretense is dropped and the crew is subjected to a DNA test and then returned to Voyager. When they are returned, they discover that one crew member, Ensign Harry Kim, is missing. They then realize that the maquis ship that they where sent to find has been transported to the Delta Quadrant as well. When they make contact, they discover that one of their crew members, Torres, is missing as well, they both agree to launch a joint rescue mission. They then transport back to the array, the last place that they where both seen. They then encounter an old man who won't give them a straight answer; the only thing that the crew members can get out of him that there \"isn't enough time left\". He then transports them back to Voyager. Once there, a crew member reports that the array is acting strangely and that it has been sending out intermittent energy pulses. The crew then track these energy pulses to a nearby star system, but there is something very peculiar about the plant that is receiving them. There are no nucleogenic particles in the atmosphere, which should make the formation of an atmosphere impossible. Captain Janeway then decides to set course for the planet, as it may hold clues to what is going on and where the missing crew members are. While this is happening, the two missing crew members, Ensign Harry Kim and Torres, both wake up to find themselves in a white room and covered in strange lumps. When Torres tries to escape she is restrained. To her credit, it takes three of the aliens to subdue her. When she regains consciousness, she and Harry are taken on a tour of where they are. They are underground! As if that weren't bad enough, Harry discovers that others who have been sent there previously with the same condition have died. He also discovers that the people the Ocampa are completely reliant on another alien life form, to whom they refer to as the Caretaker. He provided them with the city and according to an ancient text he \"opened a great whole in the ground which led to this great city\" and has taken care of them ever since.",

After a bumpy start and the help of Torres and Kim, they succeed in a holodeck simulation. When it is presented to Captain Janeway, she is impressed and gives them the go ahead to try it, but traveling faster than warp 10 has never before been attempted. The first run goes very well. Tom Paris manages to cross the warp threshold which means that the shuttle craft in which he is traveling exists simultaneously everywhere, but Tom then disappears and Harry is unable to find him anywhere within five parsecs. Tom somehow manages to return to Voyager through subspace, but there are unforeseen side-effects of his transwarp travel and Tom begins to mutate. The doctor tries to treat him with a type of radiation that will prohibit cell mutation; however, this fails and Tom dies. To the Doctor's surprise, Paris is able to regenerate himself and wakes up a couple of hours later with two hearts. His body continues mutating, with new organs growing and others being absorbed back in to his body. Tom refuses any treatment, saying that this is the best thing that ever happened to him, but deep down he is scared. A cure is found by exposing Tom to highly focused anti-proton radiation to destroy all the new DNA and allowing his original DNA to reassert itself; however, Tom breaks free from his restraints, kidnaps Captain Janeway, takes the shuttle craft to transwarp. Captain Janeway's DNA goes through the same mutagenic process as Tom's. When Voyager catches up with them on an alien planet three days later, Paris and Janeway have devolved millions of years and have mated, producing three offspring. Commander Chakotay recovers Paris and Janeway but makes the decision to leave their offspring on the otherwise unpopulated planet.",

But after the creatures draw Voyager into their midst, their unusual energy patterns create problems for many of the ship's systems and cause some very strange symptoms in Kes. First the Ocampan begins eating everything in sight. Later she becomes delirious, and her body goes through peculiar changes. As the crew tries to figure out a way to move away from the lifeforms without harming them, the Doctor examines Kes and discovers that they are wreaking havoc with her metabolism. They are pushing her prematurely into the \"elogium\" - the phase in which Ocampan women become fertile. The process occurs only once in an Ocampan's life, so if Kes ever wants to have a child, she must do so immediately. Janeway and Chakotay discuss the implications of having babies on board Voyager, while Kes asks Neelix to father her child. Neelix's initial hesitation causes Kes to question whether he really wants a baby. Later, Neelix consults with Tuvok about the pros and cons of parenthood. Finally, he returns to Kes and tells her he's ready, only to discover that now she is having second thoughts. Anxious to escape the swarm, the crew attempts to move away, but the swarm follows. Suddenly, an even larger version of the creatures appears and blocks Voyager's way. Bewildered at first, the crew realizes that it is a \"suitor\" for the swarm and that it thinks Voyager is a rival. Every aggressive move they make is met by a stronger countermove from the creature. Finally, Chakotay suggests the ship act submissively by \"rolling over.\" Happily, the plan works and the swarm moves away with the big creature. Later, Kes ultimately decides against having a baby, but is relieved by the Doctor's belief that her elogium may have been a false alarm brought on by the electrophoretic field created by the swarm; it could recur later. Ironically, Janeway learns that an ensign named Wildman is pregnant, so the crew will soon welcome a new arrival after all.",

Informed that the injured captain needs his assistance, the Doctor is sent to the Bridge, courtesy of new holo-emitters installed throughout the ship. After reviving Janeway, the Doctor is summoned to the mess hall to assist Neelix, who is engaged in battle with a Kazon soldier. After the scuffle, the holographic doctor is astonished to learn that he himself is bleeding. When queried, the computer insists that the Doctor is actually Dr. Lewis Zimmerman, the human who created Voyager's EMH. Stranger still, when the Captain tells the computer to shut down all of the ship's holographic systems, Janeway, Neelix, Torres and the Kazon soldier vanish - but the Doctor remains intact. Just then, Reg Barclay appears and introduces himself as Zimmerman's assistant. Barclay tells the Doctor that he is at Jupiter Station running a holodeck program, but something has gone wrong due to a radiation surge. He claims there's no U.S.S. Voyager lost in the Delta Quadrant; it's simply a program that Zimmerman created. He tells the Doctor that he must end the simulation before radiation from the accident kills him, and the only way to do so is by destroying Voyager. At first, the Doctor flatly refuses. Yet Reg's arguments are persuasive, and soon the Doctor is prepared to fire his phaser at Voyager's warp core. Suddenly, Chakotay appears and orders the Doctor to lower his weapon, claiming that Barclay is lying. Chakotay explains that there's been an accident on Voyager that affected the imaging system while the Doctor was in the holodeck. Chakotay says that Barclay himself is a simulation, and that if the Doctor listens to him, he'll wind up destroying his own program. The Doctor isn't sure whom to believe but delays acting on Barclay's advice long enough to prove that Chakotay's story is true. The problem is finally solved, and the Doctor is returned to Sickbay where he reflects on his unusual day.",

When Voyager returns to Rinax so that Jetrel can try to find a cure, Neelix reveals to Kes that he wasn't fighting in the Defense Force when the Metreon Cascade went off like he said. He was hiding from them since he believed the war was unjust, leading him to believe later that he was just being a coward.

When they arrive in orbit, scans reveal a massive supply; however when the away team transports down to the planet there is none there. Completely confused, Commander Chackotay orders the away team back to Voyager but before they return to Voyager, Neelix is attacked by an alien who removes his lungs. The EMH then comes up with a solution - holographic lungs, but this means that Neelix has to stay in a restraint whilst he has the lungs and he is unable to move no more then 0.2 nanometers in any direction. Captain Janeway along with Commander Tuvok and a security attachment return to the planet to find the alien who did this and they make a very gruesome discovery; a laboratory full of alien organs and then realize that there was a life in that very room less then 10 minutes ago. Scans detect the life form and when they catch up with him, Tuvok knocks the alien's weapon out of his hand. The alien escapes and leave on a ship. Voyager gives pursuit but the ships are both equally matched for speed. The alien ship then takes refuge in an asteroid; Voyager continues to scan once inside the main cavern of the asteroid. The crew see many reflections of Voyager and the alien ship however electro-magnetic interference stops them from detecting which one is the correct ship so they send out a low energy phaser beam which will past through any reflections but hit the alien ship without damaging it. Once they detect the alien ship and they beam the grew aboard, they get two very strange looking aliens called Viidans who go around harvesting organs from aliens and then grafting them on to themselves because they have a genetic disease called 'The Phage'. This disease affects them on the cellular level, so to survive they need to replace their organs regularly. Horrified by what these aliens do and how they are able to throw their morals aside and that she is unable to get Neelix's lungs back. she then sees that there is nothing she can do but to let them go, but with a harsh warning to never cross her ship again. In what appears to be an act of compassion, the aliens offer to help with the transplantation of one of Kes' lungs into Neelix.",

Eager for some culture exchange and friendly first contact, Captain Janeway grants shore leave to her crew and rolls out the welcome mat for visitors. Tuvok worries about security, Kim and Paris get drunk and start a fight, Naomi Wildman makes a lunch date with Seven. Despite a crowded ship, a few thefts, security breaches, and the gift of a plant all seems to be going well. Seven of Nine is approached by an alien who holds relics from her Borg days, actual Borg relays from her original unimatrix. Upon seeing the relays she is overwhelmed with images and strong memories of when she was last in contact with the items. She eagerly accepts them and promises compensation, not recognizing the man as Two of Nine a former member of her original unimatrix. Enter flashbacks: Eight years ago, Seven of Nine and her unimatrix crashed their sphere on a planet with only four of the nine drones surviving. Their link to the collective severed, they had to make decisions on their own. Seven gives orders and her unimatrix agrees. When they begin removing relays from a dead drone, one of the Borg is confused by the religious beliefs he held prior to his assimilation. As time passes and the drones struggle to survive, each regains memories of their individualities, including names, families, and the deaths of their loved ones at the hands of the Borg. Two of Nine was a mathematician named Lansor. Three of Nine was a Bajoran named Marika Willkarah, an engineer aboard the Excalibur with her husband. Four of Nine was a member of Species 571 named P'Chan who liked to cook and cared for his parents who were killed by the Borg. Seven only remembers a campfire with her father and being afraid of the dark. Seven orders the others to delete their memory files and cease communicating until they are reintegrated into the collective. Back on Voyager: Two of Nine and 2 other members of her Unimatrix tamper with ship's sensors and break into the cargo bay while Seven is regenerating. While one of the men remains hesitant, he agrees, and having group consensus, they access Seven's memory files by injecting tubules into her neck. Tuvok discovers the breach and security stops the assailants as Seven regains consciousness and resists. The Doctor discovers that while the three have been severed from the collective for a few months, they are linked in consciousness to one another. The drones say that the link occurred the night of the crash and they have had a separate link to one another ever since. They broke free of the Borg and had a surgeon remove their implants but no one could sever the telepathic link. As they live now, with shared memories and a blended identity, they don't know where one ends and the other begins. They sought out Seven, hoping she would hold the key to why they are linked and how to sever it. Seven finds she shares a memory gap with the trio and agrees to a dangerous link with them in order to retrieve the lost data. The procedure works and the memories show the trio destroying the distress beacon and resisting re-assimilation. Seven altered her nanoprobes to create the link between the three to restore order to their chaotic, individual minds. The procedure sends the trio into neural shock. The Doctor tells Seven he can either remove the brain implants, killing them within in weeks, or return them to the Borg where they will live full lives as drones. Chakotay and The Doctor help Seven gain perspective and she decides to give the trio what they want. The Doctor removes the link; P'Chan heads for a nearby planet to spends his weeks in fresh air, Lansor stays on the station to meet new people and Willkarah chooses to stay on Voyager until she passes away.",

An artificial temporal rift opens in front of them, and a Federation vessel from the 29th century emerges. The pilot, CAPT Braxton, says that Voyager somehow is responsible for a temporal disruption in his time that destroys Earth's solar system. So he begins an attack on them, hoping to change the future. In defending themselves, Voyager disables Braxton's time ship, and he is pulled back into the time rift; so too is Voyager. Braxton's vessel is flung back to 1967 and is the meteor seen at the beginning. Voyager only goes back to 1996. Once in the 20th century, Voyager detects a warp signature in the Los Angeles area, so an away team - Janeway, Chakotay, Paris, and Tuvok - goes to investigate. Unknowingly, a SETI scientist - Rain - who has been scanning for a particular radiation signature finds it emanating from Voyager and plots their orbit. Rain calls her boss - Henry Starling - who directs her to stay quiet until she has more data. She doesn't, and Starling sends his henchman to kill her. It's revealed that he was the camper that spotted Braxton's ship, and has been using its technology to make himself very rich and powerful for the past 3 decades. He also supplied the parameters for the radiation pattern that Rain found; he was hoping for a heads up in case any future vessels followed Braxton's ship to retrieve it. Janeway and Chakotay find Braxton, who is now a crazed homeless man that explains the temporal causality loop that Voyager is now involved in. Paris and Tuvok go to meet Rain, who had sent a welcome greeting to Voyager. They secretly take her data off her computer. When she realizes what they've done, Rain chases them. That's when Starling's goon catches up with her and tries to kill her with a phaser. Paris and Tuvok spirit her away to safety. Janeway determines that Braxton still has the time ship, and tries to beam it from Starling's possession. He fights back, and actually uses the transporter beam as a data link to steal data from Voyager's computers. He then finds out that Voyager's not from the 29th century as he'd surmised, but the 24th. He also finds he's obtained a very special piece of software from Voyager: The EMH.",

While Chekov, with Ambassador Morgan's help, comes to terms with his impending death, Kirk must work with the same Klingon captain he confronted earlier to discover who is behind the second attack, and save his ship, and possibly the future of the Federation itself.",
